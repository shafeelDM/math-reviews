            <h1> Differential Calculus </h1>
            <img src="/home/shafeeldm/repos/math-reviews/calc.jpg" width= 500px height: auto alt="A picture of someone doing differential calculus on a blackboard">
            <p> There are multiple differential calculus courses at the University of British Columbia. 
                The one I took was Math 110 which, to my knowledge, is the only <strong> 2 semester </strong> Calculus course at a major Canadian University. 
                It is restricted to students who got less than 80% in senior HS math. 
                The rationale of the it being 2 semesters is allowing students time to clear up deficits they have while being exposed to University level math for the first time.
                At the end of the 6+ months of instruction, students can leave with the same level of proficiency as the other conventional one semester calculus flavors UBC offers. 
                Suffice to say a lot of review on HS material was offered which allowed the transition to Calculus much easier.

                <h2> Doing well in the course </h2>
                    <p> Ubc offers it's own homebrew textbook for all 3 levels of calculus. spending atleast 30 minutes a day reviewing
                        practice problems from the CLP or any computationally based textbook will likely be enough exposure to do well in the course.
                        With Consistent effort and reviewing the practice midterms and finals well before the exam will result in one being successful.
                    </p>
